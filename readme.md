# lingodl

this is a simple and very janky nodejs script to rip lingo episodes from
<npostart.nl>. lingo stopped airing in 2014 (at least the good episodes). the
npo website is very slow and i wanted to download the video files so i can
store them on my private media server.

there's also another website which does something kind of similar:
[downloadgemist](https://downloadgemist.nl/index.php). it's meant to rip
anything from npostart, but my script is just meant to work on lingo (though it
might work on other programs).

it currently only downloads the video track, but i'm working on downloading the
audio tracks too.

all other npo download/ripping scripts have been patched and don't seem to work
anymore, and i don't plan on maintaining this once i'm done with it.

beware of spaghetti code!
